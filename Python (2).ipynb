        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "   -  Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "   -  An interpreter in Python is a program that reads and executes Python code line by line. Unlike a compiler, which translates the entire source code into machine code before running it, a Python interpreter translates and runs code on the fly, one statement at a time.\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "   -  Pre-defined keywords in Python (often simply called keywords or reserved words) are words that are reserved by the language because they have special meaning. These keywords are used to define the syntax and structure of Python programs and cannot be used as identifiers (e.g., variable names, function names, etc.).\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "   -  No, keywords cannot be used as variable names in most programming languages, including Python, Java, C, and JavaScript.\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "   -  In Python, mutability refers to whether or not an object can be changed after it is created.\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "   -  In Python, the mutability of a data type refers to whether its contents (elements) can be changed after the object is created. The design choice to make lists mutable and tuples immutable is deliberate and serves specific purposes.\n",
        "7. What is the difference between ‚Äú==‚Äù and ‚Äúis‚Äù operators in Python?\n",
        "   -  In Python, == and is are both comparison operators, but they have different purposes and behaviors:\n",
        "   -  == (Equality Operator)\n",
        "   -  Checks if the values of two variables are equal.\n",
        "   -  It compares the contents of the objects.\n",
        "   -  It can be overridden by defining the __eq__() method in a class.\n",
        "   -  a = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "   -  b = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "   -  print(a == b)  # True, because the contents are the same\n",
        "   -  is (Identity Operator)\n",
        "   -  Checks if two variables refer to the exact same object in memory.\n",
        "   -  It compares object identity, not value.\n",
        "   -  a = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "   -  b = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "   -  print(a is b)  # False, because they are different objects in memory\n",
        "8. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "   -  In Python, logical operators are used to combine conditional statements and evaluate the truthiness of expressions. There are three main logical operators:\n",
        "   -  1. and\n",
        "   -  Returns True if both statements are True.\n",
        "   -  Syntax: condition1 and condition2\n",
        "   -  2. or\n",
        "   -  Returns True if at least one of the statements is True.\n",
        "   -  Syntax: condition1 or condition2\n",
        "   -  3. not\n",
        "   -  Reverses the result: returns False if the result is True, and vice versa\n",
        "   -  Syntax: not condition\n",
        "9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "   -  Type casting in Python refers to the process of converting a variable from one data type to another. This is useful when you need to perform operations between different data types or when you want to change the type of data for compatibility or correctness.\n",
        "   -  Types of Type Casting in Python\n",
        "   -  1. Implicit Type Casting\n",
        "   -  Automatically done by Python.\n",
        "   -  Python converts one data type to another without user involvement.\n",
        "   -  2. Explicit Type Casting\n",
        "   -  Done manually by the programmer using built-in functions.\n",
        "   -  You explicitly convert data from one type to another.\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "   -  The difference between implicit and explicit type casting lies in who performs the conversion and how intentional it is:\n",
        "   -  üîπ Implicit Type Casting (Type Coercion)\n",
        "   -  Done automatically by the compiler or interpreter.\n",
        "   -  Happens when converting a smaller data type to a larger one, or when there is no risk of data loss.\n",
        "   -  No explicit code is needed by the programmer.\n",
        "   -üîπ Explicit Type Casting (Type Conversion)\n",
        "   -  Performed manually by the programmer\n",
        "   -  Requires using a casting operator or method\n",
        "   -  Used when you want to force a conversion that might lose information (like float to int)\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "   -  The purpose of conditional statements in Python is to allow a program to make decisions and execute certain blocks of code only when specific conditions are met.\n",
        "   -  In simple terms:\n",
        "   -  Conditional statements control the flow of a program based on whether a condition (an expression that evaluates to True or False) is satisfied.\n",
        "  -  Main conditional statements in Python:\n",
        "  -  if ‚Äî runs a block of code if a condition is True.\n",
        "  -  elif (short for else if) ‚Äî checks another condition if the previous one was False.\n",
        "  -  else ‚Äî runs a block of code if all previous conditions were False.\n",
        "12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "  -  The elif statement in Python is short for \"else if\", and it is used in conditional statements to check multiple conditions sequentially. It allows you to execute a block of code if a specific condition is true, after checking one or more previous conditions that may have been false.\n",
        "  -  Basic Structure\n",
        "  -  if condition1:\n",
        "    # Code block if condition1 is True\n",
        "  -  elif condition2:\n",
        "    # Code block if condition2 is True\n",
        "  -  elif condition3:\n",
        "    # Code block if condition3 is True\n",
        "  -  else:\n",
        "    # Code block if none of the above conditions are True\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "  -  The primary difference between for and while loops lies in how and when they check their conditions and how they are typically used. Here's a breakdown:\n",
        "  -   for Loop\n",
        "  -  Use case: When you know in advance how many times you want to loop.\n",
        "  -  Syntax (in Python):\n",
        "  -  for i in range(5):\n",
        "    print(i)\n",
        "  -  while Loop\n",
        "  -  Use case: When you don‚Äôt know how many times you'll loop in advance ‚Äî you loop until a condition becomes false.\n",
        "  -  Syntax (in Python):\n",
        "  -  i = 0\n",
        "  -  while i < 5:\n",
        "    print(i)\n",
        "    i += 1\n",
        "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop?\n",
        "  -  A while loop is more suitable than a for loop when the number of iterations is not known in advance and depends on a condition that is evaluated during runtime.\n",
        "  -  User Login System:\n",
        "  -  You're building a system that asks a user for a password until they enter the correct one. You don't know how many attempts it will take, so a while loop is ideal.\n",
        "  -  correct_password = \"secure123\"\n",
        "user_input = input(\"Enter your password: \")\n",
        "  -  while user_input != correct_password:\n",
        "    print(\"Incorrect password. Try again.\")\n",
        "    user_input = input(\"Enter your password: \")\n",
        "  -  print(\"Access granted!\")\n",
